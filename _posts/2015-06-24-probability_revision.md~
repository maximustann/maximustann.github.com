##Math notations

$\sum_x f(x) \equiv \sum_{s \in dom(x)} f(x = s)$


**Definition 1.1** (Rules of Probability for Discrete Variables)

The summation of the probability over all the state is 1:

$\sum_{x \ in dom(x)} p(x = x) = 1$

This is called normalisation condition. We write $\sum_x p(x) = 1$ for short.

Two variables $x$ and $y$ can interact through

$p(x, y) = p(x) + p(y) - p(x \cap y)$
