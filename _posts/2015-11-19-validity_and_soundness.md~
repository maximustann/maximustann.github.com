Virtues in arguments:

1. Validity
2. Soundness

**Relation between premises and conclusion**

In a deductive argument, the conclusion should **follow from** the premises

A **deductive** argument is supposed to be valid.
An **Inductive** argument is not supposed to be valid.

<!--more-->

##Validity

An argument is **Valid** if and only if 

> It is not possible that both all of its premises are true and its conclusion is false

An argument with a false premise can still be valid.

---

##Soundness

In a **Sound** argument, the conclusion must be true.

An argument is **Sound** if and only if 

1. all of its premises are true, and
2. it is valid

If a deductive argument is not sound, then it is not a good argument.

##Argument Reconstruction

Stage I: Close Analysis

Stage II: GET Down to basics

	1. Remove all excess verbiage 
	2. List all explicit premises and conclusion in standard form

Stage III: Sharpen Edges

	1. Clarify where needed
	2. Break up where possible without distortion

Stage IV: Organize parts
	
	1. Divide the argument into sub-arguments, and arrange them in order 

Stage V: Fill in gaps

	1. Assess whether each argument is valid 
	2. Add suppressed premises where needed 
	3. Check each premise for truth 
	4. Qualify premises to make them true where needed if possible 

Stage VI: Assess the argument 
	
	1. Conclude

##Stage II: Get Down to basics

###Remove all excess verbiage

1. Repetition
2. Road Markers are helpful for keeping track of an argument, but they do not add anything
to the argument itself.
3. Tangents (离题的)
4. Examples

The trick of excess verbiage

The trick of excess verbiage is to hide a problem with an argument by 
saying too much.

##Stage IV: Organize parts 

1. Linear structure: One argument depends on another argument linearly
2. Branching structure: Multiple premises support one argument
3. Joint structure: two premises working together (&)
