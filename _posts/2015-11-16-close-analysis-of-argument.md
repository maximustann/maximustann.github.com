The Problem of the **Skeptical Regress** means to trace the reason of an argument recursively. 
It could be endless. Therefore, it is a problem.

To solve **Skeptical Regress** problem, we have three ways,

1. Assuring
2. Guarding
3. Discounting 

<!--more-->

###Assuring

1. Authoritative
2. Reflexive
3. Abusive

###Authoritative

Example:

I assure you that somking is bad for your health. *The surgeon general has shown that it is bad for your 
health*(Cited Authority).

If you trust the authority, then, that's fine. But if you have to be careful about the authority.

###Reflexive

I believe that...

I think that...

###Abusive

"Nonsense!" : Get you to believe what you said is nonsense by abusing you.

"Nobody but a fool would think that..."

"Everybody knows that" : somebody is a dummy if he does not know the thing

"It's just common sense that..." : You are telling someone that if he deny that he lacks of common sense.

**So, if you don't want to hurt other people's feeling, be careful with these expressions.**

##Guarding 

The idea of guarding is make your premises weaker.

Example, 

We should not build any nuclear power plants because they **will** explode. (Unjustified argument)

We should not build any new nuclear power plants because **some** of them **might** explode. (weaker)

We should not build any nuclear power plants, because **I believe that some** of them **might** explode. ()
even weaker).

By weak the premises, you make it more likely to be ture and less subject to objection.

Three ways to do guarding:

1. Extent
2. Probability
3. Mental

###Extent

Use weaker terms: All $\Rightarrow$ Most $\Rightarrow$ Many $\Rightarrow$ Some
