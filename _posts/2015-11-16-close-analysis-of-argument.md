The Problem of the **Skeptical Regress** means to trace the reason of an argument recursively. 
It could be endless. Therefore, it is a problem.

To solve **Skeptical Regress** problem, we have three ways,

1. Assuring
2. Guarding
3. Discounting 

<!--more-->

###Assuring

1. Authoritative
2. Reflexive
3. Abusive

###Authoritative

Example:

I assure you that somking is bad for your health. *The surgeon general has shown that it is bad for your 
health*(Cited Authority).

If you trust the authority, then, that's fine. But if you have to be careful about the authority.

###Reflexive

I believe that...

I think that...

###Abusive

"Nonsense!" : Get you to believe what you said is nonsense by abusing you.

"Nobody but a fool would think that..."

"Everybody knows that" : somebody is a dummy if he does not know the thing

"It's just common sense that..." : You are telling someone that if he deny that he lacks of common sense.

**So, if you don't want to hurt other people's feeling, be careful with these expressions.**

##Guarding 

The idea of guarding is make your premises weaker.

Example, 

We should not build any nuclear power plants because they **will** explode. (Unjustified argument)

We should not build any new nuclear power plants because **some** of them **might** explode. (weaker)

We should not build any nuclear power plants, because **I believe that some** of them **might** explode. ()
even weaker).

By weak the premises, you make it more likely to be ture and less subject to objection.

Three ways to do guarding:

1. Extent
2. Probability
3. Mental

###Extent

Use weaker terms: All $\Rightarrow$ Most $\Rightarrow$ Many $\Rightarrow$ Some.

###Probability

Use probability terms: Probably, Possibly, likely and so on.

###Mental

I **know** something something..

I **believe** something something..

##Discounting

Discounting is citing a possible criticism in order to reject it or counter it.

For example, 

The ring is expensive, but it is beautiful. (This sentence does four things.)

1. It asserts (or admits) that the ring is expensive.
2. It also asserts that the ring is beautiful.
3. It contrasts the two claims.
4. It emphasizes the second claim about beauty.

**But** indicates that the sentence after is more important. You are discounting the objection.

**Functions of discounting terms**

1. They assert two claims.
2. They contrast the two claims.
3. They emphasize one of the claims.

But, Although, Even if, Even Though, Whereas, Nevertheless, Nonetheless...

**The trick of discounting straw people**

One advantage of using discounting objection is that, you get to lead the objections. This trick could
make people could not see the problem with your position. Distract them !

For example, you might say,

I have 5 objections that I'm gonna respond to,

You might say this bla bla, however...

You might say that bla bla, but...

...

Then, you get to pick easy objections. The audiences might forget some hard questions.

##Evaluation language

Evaluation language is also used to stop the skeptical regress. 

For example, 

A member of Congress could say “You should support my budget plan because it will be good for the country.”

The premise is made more defensible here because specific standards aren’t being applied.  
Two different people could agree that the budget plan will be good, but for completely different reasons.  
One  person may find it to be fiscally responsible while another may like the fact that it benefits a 
pet project.  They each agree that the plan is “good.”

The word "good" could mean *meet the standards*, "bad" mean *not meet the standards*. But it is very
vague that it does not claim what is the standard. It just implies by the context.

This makes the claim more defensible since our standards cannot be questioned if they are not presented.


Reason Maker = R

Conclusion Maker = C

Assuring Term = A

Guarding Term = G

Discounting Term = D

Positive Evaluative Term = E+

Negative Evaluative Term = E-
